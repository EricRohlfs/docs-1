Anchoring and ledger integrity
==============================

Openchain is capable of immutability by committing a hash of the entire ledger (the **cumulative hash**) onto a non-reversible Blockchain such as Bitcoin.

:ref:`"Observer nodes" <observer-nodes>` replicating all the verified transactions locally have the ability to compute their own version of the cumulative hash and compare it to the anchor in the Bitcoin blockchain.
