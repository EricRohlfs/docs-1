Is Openchain a block chain?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Openchain is not a *block chain* by itself, but a close cousin. A block chain is a data structure where a series of blocks are ordered and linked cryptographically through hashing. Usually, a block is a set of transactions. Openchain links transactions cryptographically through hashing, however it doesn't have a concept of blocks, so Openchain should be considered as a *transaction chain* rather than a *block chain*.
