Using the Openchain Wallet
==========================

Openchain Server exposes a :ref:`public HTTP API <http-api>`, which can be called by any program capable of making HTTP calls.

To wrap all those operations in a user-friendly user interface, we also provide a client: the Openchain Wallet.

The Openchain Wallet is an open source web based interface, available at `wallet.openchain.org <https://wallet.openchain.org>`_.
